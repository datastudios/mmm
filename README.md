# Introduction

The B2C (business-to-consumer) healthcare insurance industry encompasses companies offering individual and family health insurance plans directly to consumers. These plans provide coverage for medical expenses incurred for various health services and treatments. Key features of the B2C healthcare insurance industry include:

* Focus on individual and family plans: Unlike B2B (business-to-business) insurance, which caters to employer-sponsored plans, B2C primarily focuses on individual and family policies purchased directly by consumers.
* Diverse product offerings: Companies offer a variety of health insurance plans with different coverage levels, deductibles, co-pays, and network options to cater to diverse needs and budgets.
* Competitive landscape: The market is highly competitive, with numerous insurance providers vying for market share. This competition can lead to innovative product offerings and competitive pricing.
* Regulatory environment: The industry is heavily regulated by government agencies to ensure consumer protection and financial stability.
* Technology adoption: Technology plays a significant role in the industry, with online enrollment platforms, telemedicine services, and mobile apps becoming increasingly popular.
